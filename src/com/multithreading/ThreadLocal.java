->Thread local class provides thread local variables.
->Thread local class maintains values per thread basis
->each thread local object maintains a separate value like userId ,transactionId etc for each thread that access that object
->thread can access the local variable and manipulate the value , in every part of the code which is executed by thread we can access its local variable.
